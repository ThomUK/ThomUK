### Hi, I'm an data analyst manager in the NHS.  I believe strongly in:

* The importance of data, analysis, and information for good decision-making.
* Analysis produed using reproducible methods (in the NHS that means R and python, complete with shared code).
* Open-source code.  Many pairs of eyes are better than one.  Stand on the shoulders of giants (and let others stand on yours).
* The power of community.  We are all trying to solve similar problems - don't under-estimate the help you can provide by shaing what you already know.
